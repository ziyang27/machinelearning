## Critical Notes

### Backpropagation in RNNs:
**Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** is the training algorithm for recurrent neural networks like LSTMs. Unlike standard backpropagation:

- **Temporal Unfolding**: The network is "unrolled" across time steps, creating a deep feedforward network
- **Gradient Flow**: Gradients flow backward through both network layers AND time steps
- **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: Traditional RNNs suffer from exponentially decreasing gradients over long sequences
- **LSTM Solution**: Gate mechanisms (forget, input, output gates) control information flow, maintaining gradient strength across long sequences
- **Memory Cell**: The cell state provides a "highway" for gradients to flow unchanged, solving long-term dependency learning

**Key Insight**: LSTM's gate structure allows selective information retention/forgetting, enabling effective learning of long-range dependencies that traditional RNNs cannot capture.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Computational Complexity**: LSTM training requires significant memory and processing time
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Learning rates, dropout rates, and architecture choices critically impact performance
- **Dataset Quality**: Sentiment analysis performance heavily depends on training data diversity and quality
- **Context Understanding**: Model limitations in handling sarcasm, cultural nuances, and domain-specific language

This project successfully demonstrates advanced sentiment analysis using LSTM networks, showcasing deep learning expertise in natural language processing. The implementation covers the complete pipeline from raw text processing to deployed predictive systems.
