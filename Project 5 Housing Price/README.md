- Enhanced predictive power through domain-specific feature engineering

#### Data Standardization:
- **StandardScaler**: Applied feature scaling from `sklearn.preprocessing`
- Normalized all features to standard scale (mean=0, std=1)

### 5. Model Development & Training

#### Algorithm Implementation:
- **Linear Regression**: `sklearn.linear_model` - Baseline regression model
- **Random Forest Regressor**: `sklearn.ensemble` - Advanced ensemble method

#### Model Optimization:

- **Transformation Benefits**: Log transformation effectively handles skewed distributions
- **Model Comparison**: Random Forest typically outperforms Linear Regression for complex patterns
- **Hyperparameter Importance**: Grid search significantly improves model performance
- **Scaling Necessity**: Feature standardization crucial for distance-based algorithms

## Critical Notes
- **Early Data Splitting**: Acknowledged that train-test split should have been performed later in the pipeline
  - *Risk*: Potential data leakage from preprocessing steps
  - *Best Practice*: Split data after initial exploration but before feature engineering
- **Feature Transformation Timing**: Ensure transformations are applied consistently to training and test sets
- **Grid Search Computational Cost**: Consider computational resources when defining parameter grids

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning approach to house price prediction, showcasing advanced preprocessing techniques and model optimization strategies. The implementation of log transformations, custom feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning resulted in robust predictive models.
